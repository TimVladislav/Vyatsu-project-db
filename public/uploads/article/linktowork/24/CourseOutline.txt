   The Information for Students



Assignments: Late assignments, lab reports or projects will not be accepted for marking. Assignments must be done on an
individual basis unless otherwise specified by the instructor.

Makeup Tests, Exams or Quizzes: There will be no makeup tests, exams or quizzes. If you miss a test, exam or quiz, you will
receive zero marks. Exceptions may be made for documented medical reasons or extenuating circumstances. In such a case, it
is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor immediately.

Ethics: BCIT assumes that all students attending the Institute will follow a high standard of ethics. Incidents of cheating or
plagiarism may, therefore, result in a grade of zero for the assignment, quiz, test, exam, or project for all parties involved
and/or expulsion from the course.

Attendance: The attendance policy as outlined in the current BCIT Calendar will be enforced.

The following statements are in accordance with the BCIT Policies 5101, 5102, 5103, and 5104, and their accompanying

procedures. To review these policies and procedures, please refer to: www.bcit.ca/about/administration/policies.shtml

Attendance/Illness:
In case of illness or other unavoidable cause of absence, the student must communicate as soon as possible with his/her

instructor or Program Head or Chief Instructor, indicating the reason for th e absence. Prolonged illness of three or more
consecutive days must have a BCIT medical certificate sent to the department. Excessive absence may result in failure or
immediate withdrawal from the course or program. Please see Policy 5101 — Student Regulations, and accompanying
procedures: http://www.bcit.ca/files/pdf/policies/5101.pdf


Academic Misconduct:
Violations of academic integrity, including dishonesty in assignments, examinations, or other academic performances are
prohibited and will be handled in accordance with Policy 5104 — Academic Integrity and Appeals, and accompanying

procedures: http://www.bcit.ca/files/pdf/policies/5104.pdf

Attempts:
Students must successfully complete a course within a maximum of three attempts at the course. Students with two attempts in

a single course will be allowed to repeat the course only upon special written permission from the Associate Dean. Students
who have not successfully completed a course within three attempts will not be eligible to graduate from their respective
program.Accommodation:
Any student who may require accommodation from BCIT because of a physical or mental disability should refer to BCIT’s

Policy on Accommodation for Students with Disabilities (Policy #4501), and contact BCIT’s Disability Resource Centre
(SW1-2300, 604-451-6963) at the earliest possible time. Requests for accommodation must be made to the Disability Resource
Centre, and should not be made to a course instructor or Program area.


Any student who needs special assistance in the event of a medical emergency or building evacuation (either because of a
disability or for any other reason) should also promptly inform their course instructor(s) and the Disability Resource Centre of
their personal circumstances.
